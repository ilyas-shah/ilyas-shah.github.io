              <blockquote>
                Majid Nisar is   Project Manager/ Head  software Development & Devops
                at E-Resolute Consultancy and Services (P) Ltd. While he enjoys
                vintage cars, he really loves working on the Cars team. Majid has
                spent a majority of her decade-long career as a full-stack
                developer using DOT Net technologies, Javascript, and CSS, but has a particular
                fondness for front-end technologies. When he is not solving problems or learning new
                technologies, his spare time is spent clicking pictures he also enjoyes reading fiction (especially
                sci-fi, mystery, and trashy period romance novels), and is
                fascinated by space.

              <blockquote>
                I am single, one nephew and Neice and a wonderful family , all of whom
                understand my need to learn more , grow more every day ,something to calm my overclocked mind.

              <h2>What others say about me</h2>

              <blockquote>I would probably describe Majid as a smart, yet, insightful person. He is thoughtful on his approach to software problems while still considering the people working on them and people using them. Outside of work she's been a great person to get to know and I've enjoyed our chats.</blockquote>
